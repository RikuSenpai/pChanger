# pChanger | Changing Things Up
A simple C++ cheat for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive that has the main goal of keeping the game legit but visually appealing and fun. The only thing that may give an advantage is the Auto Bunnyhop and Hitmarkers. Besides that, this cheat is purely for fun and doesn't include Aimbot, Triggerbot, ESP, or any other game advantage features.
## Note for Those That Are Pasting
You will have to change the VC++ Directories yourself, otherwise you will receive a lot of errors.
## Agreement
If you are to use this, I hold no responsibilities for you getting VAC Banned, Untrusted Banned, or Game Banned. So use this at your own discretion.
