# pChanger | Changing Things Up
A simple C++ cheat for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive that has the main goal of keeping the game legit but visually appealing and fun. The only thing that may give an advantage is the Auto Bunnyhop, Hitmarkers, No Flash, No Smoke, and Wire Smoke. Besides that, this cheat is purely for fun and doesn't include Aimbot, Triggerbot, ESP, or any other game advantage features.
## Changelog
Nothing have been changed as of the post.
## Known Bugs
- No Smoke and Wire Smoke are bugged when inside of smoke
- Custom Models don't crouch or walk
- Menu Theme and GUI Settings don't work
- Auto Accept may not always work
- No Name Clan Tag doesn't hide name in kill feed
- Inventory Changer doesn't save in Configs
## Note for Compiling
You will have to change the VC++ Directories yourself, otherwise you will receive a lot of errors.
## Agreement
If you are to use this, I hold no responsibilities for you getting VAC Banned, Untrusted Banned, or Game Banned. So use this at your own discretion.
